## Description

Optimized SEO with meta data and help accessibility.

Updated the HTML by removing div and adding defining semantic elements such as: main, article, section, aside, etc.

Shortened CSS by making sure there was only one class to represent the same thing. Also reorganized to appear in a logical structure.
